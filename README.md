# THE GOOD SHEET
Grown tired of a plethora of poorly designed character sheets for the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, we decided to make our own.

There are a lot of character sheets available online for free and most of them put a lot of effort into their visual design to look exiting and give the right atmosphere, which makes the game more fun.
However, in our opinion, most sheets are cluttered with unnecessary boxes or impractical layouts.
While these sheets may be enough for a lot of players, they weren't for us.

The aim of the Good Sheet is to provide a concise overview of your character and their most common behaviour in combat, preferably on a single page.
To reach this conciseness we intentionally leave out all boxes which would represent frequently changing values, e.g. current hit points, temporary hit points, ammonition, and current spell slots, and we choose a rather minimal visual design.
