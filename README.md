# [The Good Sheet](https://tentawhat.github.io/good_sheet/)

Grown tired of a plethora of poorly designed character sheets for the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons, we decided to make our own.

## Motivation

There are a lot of character sheets available online for free and most of them put a lot of effort into their visual design to look exiting and give the right atmosphere, which makes the game more fun.
However, in our opinion, most sheets are cluttered with unnecessary boxes or impractical layouts.
While those sheets may be good enough for a lot of players, they aren't for us.

The aim of The Good Sheet is to provide a concise overview of your character and their most common behaviour in combat, preferably on a single page.
To reach this conciseness we intentionally leave out all boxes which would represent frequently changing values, e.g. current hit points, temporary hit points, ammunition, and current spell slots, and we choose a rather minimal visual design.

## Usage

You can access The Good Sheet [here](https://tentawhat.github.io/good_sheet/).
Enter your character data directly within the browser and save a pdf or print
it using the built-in print menu of your browser (make sure to enable the
option to print backgrounds).
